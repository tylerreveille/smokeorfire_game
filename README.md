# smokeorfire_game
My first pygame project.  I really wanted to use this to explain how XML string repositories can be used for L10N workflows, as I've seen over the years

The _OG and _XML variations are the same game, but they differ on how they gather their game strings before the select language menu appears

See the _XML variation to utilize the game_strings.xml xml file

See the _JSON variatino to utilzie the game_Strings.json file
